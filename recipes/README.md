This directory contains the conda recipes that are used to create the packages
hosted at the Anaconda Cloud in the [rpi channel](https://anaconda.org/rpi).

The majority of these recipes were derived from
[conda-forge](http://conda-forge.github.io/).  Additionally, a few recipes were
derived from Continuum's 
[anaconda-recipes](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes) repository.

The BSD licenses from these sources are included in this directory.
